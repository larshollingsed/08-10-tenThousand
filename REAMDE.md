#### Playing the game
 - Each round starts with six dice.  After they are rolled, a player may choose any scorable dice to keep and roll the rest.
 - At least one scorable die must be saved before rolling again.
 - If a player is able to score all 6 dice, they are allowed to continue rolling.
 - If any roll contains no scorable options, the player's turn is over.
 - After 350 points have been accumulated, a player may choose to end their turn and bank these points permanently.
 
#### Scoring - 
 - Single fives are worth 50 points
 - Single ones are worth 100 points
 - Three of a kind are worth 100 points times the number rolled, except for three ones which are worth 1000 points
 - If four, five, or six of a kind are rolled, each additional die is worth double the three of a kind score
 - A straight from 1 to 6 is worth 1500 points.
 - Three pairs is worth 750 points. For instance 2+2, 4+4, 5+5. This rule does not count if you roll a quadruple and a pair.
 - Any six dice which would otherwise be unscorable are worth 750 points.
